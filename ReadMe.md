## Initiating the Digital Transformation
The push for Digital Transformation comes from the office of the CIO and follows a top-down approach. They task the Architecture Board, comprising of Principal Architects and Enterprise Architects, to carry the intiative forward. The Architecture Board oversee the implementation of the strategy and are responsible for the review and maintenance of the overall architecture. They set the motion by engaging the Enterprise Architecture (EA) team.

EA comprises of following architecture domains - application, data, infrastructrue, information security, systems integration & cloud architecture. They translate business vision and strategy into effective enterprise change by creating, communicating, and refining the key insights (requirements, principles, models) that describe the Enterprise's future state and enable evolution and transformation. The goals of the EA are to improve the organizational efficiency, effectiveness, and agility by delivering business‐aligned future states and roadmaps to achieve the vision of leadership.

## Evolution
In the initial stage of evolution, EA tend to figure out the answer to the questions like 
1. Why go to the cloud? For cost, efficiency, Big Data, Machine Learning or AI?
2. What data do I take into cloud?
3. How to secure my apps & data in the cloud?
4. How do I integrate my systems with the cloud?

While answering the above questions, one must remember: 
> **Cloud is a capability, not a place**

It is important for an Enterprise to understand that the path to digital transformation is not migrating to the cloud, rather building your own technology capability. To achieve this goal, EA works on key areas of architecture management i.e. Design, Build & Deploy, laying emphasis on the following three elements
* Process
* Technology
* People
