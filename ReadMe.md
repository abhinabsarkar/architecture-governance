# Enterprise Architecture Governance for Digital Transformation

## What is Architecture Governance?
Architecture governance is an approach, a series of processes, a cultural orientation, and set of owned responsibilities that ensure the integrity and effectiveness of the organization's architectures.

## Initiating the Digital Transformation
The push for Digital Transformation comes from the office of the CIO and follows a top-down approach. They task the Architecture Board, comprising of Principal Architects and Enterprise Architects, to carry the intiative forward. The Architecture Board oversee the implementation of the strategy and are responsible for the review and maintenance of the overall architecture. They set the motion by engaging the Enterprise Architecture (EA) team.

EA comprises of following architecture domains - application, data, infrastructrue, information security, systems integration & cloud architecture. They translate business vision and strategy into effective enterprise change by creating, communicating, and refining the key insights (requirements, principles, models) that describe the Enterprise's future state and enable evolution and transformation. The goals of the EA are to improve the organizational efficiency, effectiveness, and agility by delivering business‐aligned future states and roadmaps to achieve the vision of leadership.

## Evolution
In the initial stage of evolution, EA tend to figure out the answer to the questions like 
1. Why go to the cloud? For cost, efficiency, Big Data, Machine Learning or AI?
2. What data do I take into cloud?
3. How to secure my apps & data in the cloud?
4. How do I integrate my systems with the cloud?

While answering the above questions, one must remember: 
> **Cloud is a capability, not a place**

It is important for an Enterprise to understand that the path to digital transformation is not migrating to the cloud, rather building your own technology capability. To achieve this goal, EA works on key areas of architecture management i.e. Design, Build & Deploy, laying emphasis on the following three elements

## 1. Process
* RACI Matrix - Build a RACI matrix assigning roles to stakeholders to have them Responsible Accountable, Consulted or Informed.

* Solution Delivery Process - Build end-to-end solution delivery process which includes On-boarding, Design (SAR), Build (Standards, best practices for build & test (unit testing, load testing, performance testing)), Deploy (Devops using CICD pipeline, pipeline as a code) & Operation Management (Alert & Monitoring)

* Regulatory compliance - Ensure process for regulatory compliance like auditing & data security

## 2. Technology
* Architecture - Build the architecture by creating templates for Subscription Management, High Availability, Disaster Recovery, Instrumentation - Alerting & monitoring

* Solution blocks & Design patterns - Create solution blocks and design patterns for recurring requirements for enterprise applications like user authentication, App-to-app authentication & App Integration

* Developer experience - Maximize the efficiency of the developers by simplifying the process of developing, deploying, operating and supporting software so that they can concentrate on building apps. Focus on CICD (seamless deployment of applications from source code), operational visibility & managing cross-platform environments

## 3. People
* Training & certifications - Provide training to people on the technologies adopted in the enterprise and award them for completing certifications.

* Boot-camps & Tech-talks - Evangelize the adoption of going digital & technology transformation across the enterprise by creating a network of platform champions through boot-camps and tech-talks.
